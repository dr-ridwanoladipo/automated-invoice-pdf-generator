# Invoice PDF Generator

This project demonstrates automated data processing and PDF generation using Python. The script reads multiple Excel 
files containing invoice data and converts each into a professionally formatted PDF document, making it suitable for 
applications in finance, accounting, and automated reporting.

## Key Features

- **Automated Invoice Processing**: Reads data from Excel files and dynamically generates PDF invoices.
- **Data Manipulation with Pandas**: Utilizes the `pandas` library for efficient data handling and transformation.
- **Custom PDF Design with FPDF**: Generates customized, well-formatted invoices with headers, tables, and totals 
- using the `FPDF` library.
- **Batch Processing**: Capable of handling multiple invoice files in a single run.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Python programming with an emphasis on data manipulation and file handling.
- Expertise in using `pandas` for data analysis and transformation.
- Proficiency in creating dynamic and professional-looking documents using `FPDF`.
- Automation of repetitive tasks, demonstrating efficiency and attention to detail.

## How It Works

1. **Read Invoice Data**: The script searches the `invoices` directory for all `.xlsx` files containing invoice data.
2. **Process and Generate PDF**: For each file, it extracts relevant information (invoice number, date, item details)
     and generates a PDF invoice with a custom layout.
3. **Save Output**: The generated PDFs are saved to the `PDFs` directory, named after the original Excel files.

## Technology Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- FPDF
- Pathlib
